This is a simple demo that integrates an XOR TensorFlow model implemented in Python ([repo](https://github.com/MChehab94/Keras-XOR)).
Their are two modules:
* app: Java implementation
* kotlin: Kotlin implementation  

A thorough explanation of the source code is available [here](http://mobiledevhub.com/2018/09/29/android-integrating-xor-tensorflow-model/).
